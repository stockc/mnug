### What?

On 25th of September we have the following schedule:


*   **18:30: Doors open**

*   **19:30: No Docker Required: Building Node.js Container Images**  
    by [Martin H&ouml;fling](/speakers.html#martinh) and [Patrick Harb&ouml;ck](/speakers.html#patrickh)

    While Docker is still most popular for packaging and running Node.js
    apps in containers, it has security and scalability shortcomings for
    production systems and build pipelines. Recently alternatives have
    emerged to build container images without Docker. Each of these address
    common problems: building without elevated privileges, reproducible
    results, caching of intermediate layers and scaling CI/CD in larger
    organizations.
    
    We first introduce the basic structure of a container image and compare
    the build process for tools supporting Node.js. After demonstrating
    their usage, we give guidance for selecting the right tool – which might
    not always be Docker.

*   **20:30: Amplify Your Web App - Cloud Backends with AWS Amplify**  
    by [Andreas Greimel](/speakers.html#andreasg)

    [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/) is a framework to integrate
    various AWS services into your web application.  In this talk I will
    demonstrate how to bootstrap a complete web app backend very quickly, including
    User authentication and registration A RESTful API Hosting, optionally using a
    CDN And powerful analytics tools
