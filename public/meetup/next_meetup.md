# Meetup: April 8th, 2020

On 8th of April we would like to invite you to our next community meetup of the Munich Node.JS User Group. This time we will have a virual meetup at Zoom.
Please sign up on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Node-js-User-Group/events/269878119/) and [Zoom](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_xqsr0frtRMWPv7SrxyDBxQ) to give us a hint how many nodehackers are coming!

### What?

On 8th of April 2020 we have the following schedule:


*   **18:45: Zoom open**  

    We open the stream 15min before the first talk

*   **19:00: TypeScript + Node.js = <3**  
    by [Golo Roden](/speakers.html#golor)

    In recent years, TypeScript has taken the hearts of JavaScript developers
    by storm. It is incredibly easy to use TypeScript on the client – but what
    about the server? How do you combine TypeScript with Node.js? What seems simple
    at first glance turns out to be not so easy at all on closer inspection: Not
    only does Node.js have to handle TypeScript, but also code analysis, tests, …

    Golo Roden shows how all this can be achieved in a simple way, what
    pitfalls there are, and what you have to watch out for. The result is a setup
    that can be easily transferred to new and existing projects, with which
    development with TypeScript under Node.js feels practically the same as with
    JavaScript.  

*   **20:00: Wormholes in JavaScript**  
    by [Mathias Buus Madsen](/speakers.html#mathiasb)

    A brief overview into how knowing how computers work internally, can make your
    JavaScript run much faster! I’ll give multiple live coding demos on how to
    apply these “wormholes” to real life algorithms
