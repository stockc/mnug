Please sign up on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Node-js-User-Group/events/265734183/) to give us a hint how many nodehackers are coming!

### What?

On 24th of October we have the following schedule:


*   **18:30: Doors open**

*   **19:30: The Future Should Be Isomorphic**  
    by [Lukas Taegert-Atkinson](/speakers.html#lukast)

    Remember that web development used to be instant fun? But it appears that
    these days, tooling is getting more between you and the web than ever. This
    will be a sketch of a different future where fun and instant gratification
    align with the highly optimized code expected these days, a future that has
    already started.

*   **20:30: Amplify Your Web App - Cloud Backends with AWS Amplify**  
    by [Andreas Greimel](/speakers.html#andreasg)

    [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/) is a framework to integrate
    various AWS services into your web application. 
    
    In this talk I will demonstrate how to bootstrap a complete web app backend
    very quickly, including user authentication and registration, a RESTful API,
    hosting (optionally using a CDN) and powerful analytics tools. [Video](https://youtu.be/fVocPeDZTLc)

*   **21:30: RPC & JavaScript Functions as API**
    by [Romuald Brillout](/speakers.html#romualdb)

    [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) is an old
    technique for inter-process communication that can be dated back as earlier as
    the 70s.

    With the recent advent of gRPC (https://grpc.io), RPC is making
    a resurgence and is getting popular in the industry. Large companies, such
    as Google and Netlix, are starting to replace REST/GraphQL with RPC for
    internal APIs.

    Beyond internal APIs, can RPC be used for web development?

    We will explore the benefits and drawbacks of RPC in the context of web
    development by comparing it with REST and GraphQL. We will then present an
    RPC library for Node.js and the browser.
