*   **20:15: Microservices with Feathers.js**  
    by [Dimitri Dumonet](/speakers.html#dimitrid)

    Microservices are becoming more and more popular but compared to monolithic
    architectures, are harder to use when starting new projects.
    With [feathers.js](https://feathersjs.com/) you can start off with a
    monolithic approach but also can easily create microservices out of existing
    code when necessary. This can be done by using feathers services from other
    microservices as if they were part of the main application.
