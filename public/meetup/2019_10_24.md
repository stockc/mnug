*   **19:45: The Future Should Be Isomorphic**  
    by [Lukas Taegert-Atkinson](/speakers.html#lukast)

    Remember that web development used to be instant fun? But it appears that
    these days, tooling is getting more between you and the web than ever. This
    will be a sketch of a different future where fun and instant gratification
    align with the highly optimized code expected these days, a future that has
    already started. [Video](https://youtu.be/FcjjT2KuZ90)

*   **20:30: RPC & JavaScript Functions as API**
    by [Romuald Brillout](/speakers.html#romualdb)

    [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) is an old
    technique for inter-process communication that can be dated back as earlier as
    the 70s.

    With the recent advent of [gRPC](https://grpc.io), RPC is making a
    resurgence and is getting popular in the industry. Large companies, such as
    Google and Netlix, are starting to replace REST/GraphQL with RPC for internal APIs.

    Beyond internal APIs, can RPC be used for web development?

    We will explore the benefits and drawbacks of RPC in the context of web
    development by comparing it with REST and GraphQL. We will then present an
    RPC library for Node.js and the browser. [Video](https://youtu.be/i8C9JNhMb5I)

*   **21:00: ngqp: Synchronizing form controls with the URL in Angular**
    by [Ingo B&uuml;rk](/speakers.html#ingob)

    Data-driven applications often contain text search, filter or pagination interactions. By reflecting these parameters on the URL we can often improve user experience. ngqp is a library for Angular to achieve this easily and declaratively, avoiding boilerplate code and many headaches.
